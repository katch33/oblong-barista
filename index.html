                update it
                once a day with a journal post and spend way too long staring at it's source in gitpod without making

            <h2><br><br>Day 11 - Thursday 12th May</h2>
            <p>
                I've decided to come up with a more consistent format for these entries. Not starting today as once
                again I am typing late at night, but generally I would like to be able to scroll back through these and
                see a few key points: what my coding progression was, what happened regarding my job/search for a job,
                what music I listened to, what I ate and how I felt throughout or about the day. I think that sort of
                consistency is the next step in writing this journal. SO in that rough spirit here we go:
                <br>
                <br>
                I spent some time this morning trying to get to grips with CSS Grid. It is beginning to make more sense
                to me and so I want to use tomorrow to focus on practicing some layouts and moving items around. Once
                I've one that I'm going to try and restructure this site. I worked on that from about 10.20 to 12.30 am.
                <br>
                <br>
                Regarding employment I got a phonecall from an axe throwing club about working as a casual instructor
                (read: trained and on call I think) and doing some front of house and social media/email stuff for them.
                I have 2 shadow sessions on Saturday to see what I think and how they like me so fingers crossed that
                goes well. I also noticed that the Circle K chain are hiring and I'm considering applying for a full
                time position with them as the axe club would only be temporary work.
                <br>
                <br>
                I did some chores at my family house today, mostly outdoor work so I was pretty wrecked. It's a 30
                minute drive from where I live so I left after lunch, spent about an hour or so there and came back. I
                put my entire usic library on shuffle today while on my bike so the journey was a mix of Opeth, The
                Offspring, Primus and Meshuggah. While coding I listened to a lot of Starjunk 95 and DR. GABBA on
                youtube. (I'm really looking forward to going through all of these entries tomorrow and adding links to
                things I feel should be links.)
                <br>
                <br>
                My plan for Friday is to spend 2 hours in the morning experimenting with Grid and then to do some work
                on this site. Mobile formatting is messed up right now and given how simple this site is I think Grid
                would be a good way t build something well structured. I will test it out on everything from an
                ultrawide monitor to my phone.
                <br>
                <br>
                END TRANSMISSION (this is a bad sign-off I suspect)
            </p>


            <h2><br><br>Day 10 - Wednesday 11th May</h2>
            <p>
                What to say about today? It felt like a struggle. I started back to the Product Landing project but
                really
                struggled. I just found myself fighting with CSS and trying to create a basic layout organised into
                setions but it
                didn't work they way I hoped. It was really disheartening to feel incapable at such an early hurdle but
                I know
                that not every day will be a good one, like with anything else there will always be times that it's
                harder to gain
                focus and keep the goal in sight.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alongside this I've slowed slightly in my game dev practice, mostly due to the focus I've had on
                frontend web
                development. I do want to be consistent with both but the fear I have underneath a lot of this is that
                if I can't
                make a decent living I will never have time for either. RIght now frontend seems like a clearer choice
                to make
                money I can use to fund my game development. It's such early days because realistically I'm not at a
                place where
                either one of those things is possible yet. Having a goal and motivation is good but I've always
                struggled with
                discipline and working under my own steam the whole time is proving hard. Building discipline and
                routine has been
                a big part of my efforts to change my life and I know it won't happen overnight, after all it's only
                been 10 days!
                That's such a small a ount of time relatively speaking and I have learned a lot. I've made this website,
                I've
                built some simple game prototypes and I've realised that I have the head for this. I'm just not doing a
                good job
                of being a supportive friend to myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                I don't have much more to say this evening. Both of my working Thinkpad batteries are giving less than
                an hour of
                juice so I nee to power cycle them a few times and see if I can get a good read on them. I may have a
                look to see
                what flavour of linux provides the best in system power management. I do have some other news however. I
                applied
                for a position as an axe throwing instructor and received a reply. While the full time position is gone
                they are
                looking for part time instructors as well as an IT support person. I'm not sure what kind of issues they
                will want
                mdealth with but both of those roles sound pretty interesting so I will be speaking with them tomorrow.
                All going
                well I might have a regular income that's slightly higher than my unemployment benefit which would be
                fantastic.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will leave my journal with this image. I picture myself on a boat. THe sky is blue and the sun is
                bright. THere
                is no sound save the lapping of the water against the hull, some music drifting from below deck. I am
                soaking wet,
                standing by the wheel. In the air the smell of vegetables charring on the barbecue rises. I pick up my
                towel and
                dry quickly before pulling my shirt over my head and sitting down on deck. I pick up a cold beer and
                take a sip
                before my partner steps up beside me from down below. She sits down, map in hand and as we discuss our
                next
                destination I serve lunch.
                <br>
                <br>
                Au revoir ya little star.
            </p>

            <h2><br><br>Day 9 - Tuesday 10th May</h2>
            <p>
                Good evening. I say good evening because I'm currently lying in my bed typing this update on my phone.
                For some
                reason I thought the best thing to do this morning would be to open up my laptop and clean the fans and
                remove
                some rattling loose pieces of plastic. This done, and the energy of tech repair flowing strongly through
                me I then
                moved in to disassembling my X230 Thinkpad. I picked it up a few years ago on eBay and I loved it, but
                the two big
                issues were battery life and fan noise. So with my laptop ifixit kit laid out beside me I removed every
                screw,
                clasp and bit of tape until I was finally at the stage where I could clean and repaste the CPU. Of
                course that was
                also the moment that I realised that I had absolutely nothing to clean the old thermal paste off with.
                Usually I
                would use surgical spirits so it was off to the pharmacy. Luckily they had it and I was able to jump
                back home and
                crack on. Once repasted and reassembled I fired it up and then got to work power cycling all the old
                x230
                batteries I had collected. The best lifespan I got was about 1 hour which is dreadful, and makes it
                unlikely I can
                use it as a regular travel machine but it felt great to do. After all this was done it was lunch time
                and today we
                had porridge with raspberries and pieces of apple.
                <br><br>
                After all this it was time to code. I launched straight into the next project for my Responsive Web
                Design
                certification, a product landing page. I started by creating all the HTML I thought I would need, but
                after filing
                in the info I struggled with getting my internal page links to work. Overall this took me about an hour,
                which
                felt slow but I reminded myself that building the habit will build the skills. Rather than letting
                myself become
                overly frustrated with the issues I was having I instead began another one of Kevin Powell's tutorials
                where he
                builds a responsive site from scratch. Building through a larger project like that with the help of
                somebody
                experienced with web design is a good way to learn while doing and my intention is to return to the
                product
                landing page project on Thursday. Tomorrow will be split between some personal errands early in the
                morning and
                some game development in the afternoon. I will add some additional information to this entry tomorrow as
                it is
                very late and I need to sleep zZZzZzz Goodnight.
            </p>


            <h2><br><br>Day 8 - Monday 9th May</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UqMyldS7Q" target="_blank">Today was a good day</a>. I
                completed the
                first two submissions for the Responsive Web Design Certification on <a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>, I completed the next
                episode of the excellent <a href="" target="_blank">Porklike</a> tutorial by <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs" target="_blank">Lazy Devs
                    Academy</a> and I cooked a pretty satisfactory dinner. I'm also starting to shake some of the
                expectation of
                immediacy, my need to be instantly good at what I'm trying to accomplish. Of course I want to be good at
                it, and
                to become more skilled but putting in daily work and seeing small results has been satisfying. I
                definitely know
                how to do more than I did a week ago. Maybe not by an enormous amount, but enough to know that if I stay
                focused I
                will keep improving.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alas the spectre of money always rears its head eventually. I am currently unemployed and at some point
                soon I
                will require a job. My wonderful partner has been good and supported me over the last few months but I
                have been
                sending out applications and once employment comes knocking it will put me under more pressure in terms
                of both
                time and energy. I think being able to look back at this journal and examples of my work will help to
                motivate me
                through that changeover as I get used to working again.
                <br>
                <br>
                Musically today has been pretty quiet. I had some ocean waves breaking in my headphones on <a
                    href="https://asoftmurmur.com/" target="blank">A soft Murmur</a> and would occasionally dip my toes
                into some <a href="https://filtermusic.net/jazz" target="_blank">Smooth Jazz.com</a> on <a
                    href="https://filtermusic.net/jazz" target="_blank">Filtermusic.net</a>. I found that site a long
                time ago as a
                teenager and I've been listening to various stations there ever since.
                For lunch I had a bowl of porridge with strawberries, cacao nibs and a spoonful of sugar and I cooked a
                stir-fry
                for dinner. After this excessively normal day I'm glad to be getting into bed.
                Until tomorrow, silent void of the net!
            </p>

            <h2><br><br>Day 7 - Sunday 8th May</h2>
            <p>
                Today was reasonably productive. Aside from getting some food shopping done and wnjoying a walk in
                blistering
                sunshine I also complete the lessons and started work on the first of 5 projects to earn my Free Code
                Camp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design
                    Certification</a>. I'm
                currently at 9/10 challenges working correctly to pass the first project site. It introduced me to <a
                    href="https://codepen.io/trending" target="_blank">codepen.io</a> which I had not used before, so
                that's another
                tool in my arsenal of learning. A learn-senal? An Arse-learn? They both sound dreadful.
                <br>
                <br>
                Regarding Porklike and my game dev work I have definitely missed a few days but it will be what I start
                with
                tomorrow morning. Hopefully by the time I next update this journal tomorrow I will have a gif of my work
                to share.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today there was little music, I used the <a href="https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org/"
                    target="_blank">Free Code
                    Camp Radio</a> while I started on the first site. I will leave a link to my <a
                    href="https://codepen.io/katch33/pen/XWZXypo" target="_blank">pen</a> here so that anyone interested
                can go and
                disect my dreadful work (or provide me with handy tips....?)
                <br>
                <br>
                I also want to take a moment to step back and acknowledge that I have kept this journal going for 7
                whole days. I
                know it's not a major milestone but it's one I'm glad I reached. Reminding myself that I want to
                dedicate my time,
                energy and focus to this skill is important, and reaching small milestones like this is good. My goal
                for the next
                7 days is to complete the certiication and progress through 4-5 more Porklike tutorials. (I will also
                aim to
                create a links section that contains the resources and tutorials I have been using.)
            </p>

            <h2><br><br>Day 6 - Saturday 7th May</h2>
            <p>
                It was a glorious sunny day here almost all day and I had a family event so I didn't do much coding but
                I wanted
                to make sure I updated this journal to remind myself that building the habit is important. Whether it's
                coding or
                writing the intention is the same, to make this a daily part of my life and improve myself throught
                that. Also
                it's nice working on something I built myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                I got a haircut (always a motivation I find, makes me feel more streamlined or something), I went to a
                lovely
                gathering of people who were witty and entertaining and interesting and I was fed delicious food. Well I
                was
                provided with delicious food which I myself ate. I fed it to myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                The only coding I did was editing the README for this repo on my phone in a tattoo parlour while my
                partner got
                her haircut too. I would go so far as to say it isn't really coding to add some text and a list into the
                top of a
                pre-existing markdown document but then that means I didn't code today. Which is a bad thing. So instead
                I did do
                some markdown coding today.
                <br>
                <br>
                I didn't listen to a lot of music today but when I got back home I played a few tracks from Joni
                MItchell's
                wonderful album "Blue". Recently I read a collection of short commentaries on the album written y
                various people
                that had been inspired by it and people who had inspired some of the songs she wrote for it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I think that will be all for tonight as I don't have much else to say. Tomorrow the adventure continues.

            <h2><br><br>Day 5 - Friday 6th May</h2>
            <p>
                I've done it! I learnt how to code. I became a professional game designer. Well done everyone. I
                couldn't have
                done it without all the support and encouragement I received. Now to shut down the site and live
                remotely while
                traveling in a van and posting about it on <a href="https://pixelfed.org/" target="_blank">Pixelfed.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                I jest of course. I'm still only a semi-pro. OKay fine, I'm a hobbyist. There, are we all happy now? (
                -_-)
                <br>
                <br>
                What I actually learnt how to make today was a responsive and stylish info card in CSS and HTML. I
                followed a
                lesson by Kevin Powell on his excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kepowob"
                    target="_blank">youtube</a>
                channel and it felt very satisfying to complete. There is a <a
                    href="https://github.com/katch33/oblong-barista" target="_blank">repo</a> now that works with the
                basic card which is pretty cool. I'm going to add some more
                elements to it day by day as I progress. Once I have them fucntioning properly I will start <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajazzle" target="_blank">vajazzling</a> up my site. Speaking of
                which...
                <br>
                <br>
                I also began work on a fancier looking website for myself. 5 minutes of pro tips and I felt I could
                build
                anything. I have a concept in my head already and it's slowly taking shape. Very very slowly. On the
                gaming front
                I spent a few minutes today cleaning up some of my pico8 code and formatiing but mostly the last couple
                of days
                have been web stuff. Tomorrow will be taken up with a family event so I'm not sure where I will fit in
                some screen
                time but I'm sure I can write a rough draft of the day on my phone, and if I find a quiet room maybe I
                can bring a
                bluetooth keyboard for my phone...
                <br>
                <br>
                Usually I work at my desk. I have a rather compact desk that barely has space for the ludicrous monitor
                setup I
                use. I am fortunate enought to have been gifted a monitor by a friend that was leaving the country, so
                at present
                I am using a 34" ultrawide monitor as my main screen and a portrait orientation 27" to the right of it.
                THey don't
                really fit but that's alrright. I have some plans regarding my desk and it's layout that should give me
                a lot more
                space to breathe while I'm working.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally my soundtrack for the day was mostly Devin Townsend solo albums and some Prince. Philoso-rock
                and
                Funk'n'Roll are great music to keep my head focused. Lunch today was diced chestnut mushrooms sauteed in
                butter
                and mezze cheese served on toasted sourdough and for dinner we got our weekly takeaway from Wallace
                Taverna. I had
                one glass of whiskey and multiple coffees, waters etc. It's 23:51 so I think I need to go to sleep now.
            </p>

            <h2><br><br>Day 4 - Thursday 5th May</h2>
            <p>
                I don't think I have the passion for the practice yet. I definitely have the desire. I've got the
                capability but I
                don't feel like I wake up filled with the burning passion to be a game designer.
                <br>
                Case in point. I'm more excited about this webpage that my game design efforts. I think that's only
                because I can
                see more immediate results with this website. I can sit down and clack away <a
                    href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">ducking</a> up "how to make a linear gradient in css"
                and "center contents of div
                responsively" and BOOM! My website has evolved, my showing off is flashier, I must be getting better
                right?
                <br>
                <br>
                With games it's very different. Or it seems to be so far. You have an idea, a concept. I want to make a
                Breakout
                style game! Perfect. Nice and simple. All I need is a ball. And a paddle. And some bricks. And some
                physics. And
                some controls. And a score/level system. And maybe something to handle special effects. And maybe some
                sound
                design...
                <br>(And maybe)<sup>n</sup>
            </p>

            <h2><br><br>Day 3 - Wednesday 4th May</h2>
            <p>I spent the majority of today working through the start of the <a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code
                    Camp</a> course in HTML5 and CSS. I decided that if I was going to have my own website I may as well
                learn how
                to make it as well as possible. It's been a long time since I've done any website coding and I'm finding
                it
                refreshing. I was tempted not to write anything and say that the website would stand for itself as my
                journal but
                that's nonsense. An excuse not to stick to my commitment to become my own boss and make videogames for a
                living.
                While it may seem that frontend website design isn't a step on the path to being a game developer I
                think it's
                important to keep my mind flexible and learning the same concepts across different systems and
                languages. After
                all a lot of the articles I have read seem to say that the language you use is not itself so important,
                but rather
                the concepts you apply. We'll see if that's true.
                <br>
                My favourite thing about today was figuring out how to use git from the command line in gitpod again.
                Setting that
                environment up and succesfully doing something felt great. TO go from my older markdown page to this
                (admittedly
                hideous) self made site feels good. Tomorrow I will be very late getting my daily practice done and
                writing my
                journal entry but I will still do it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today I listened to a lot of Offspring, Devin Townsend and <a href="https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org/"
                    target="blank">Free Code Camp Radio</a> with a background of waves and birds courtesy of <a

            <p class="warning"><br><br>Everything below this point is from my wordpress markdown site and not formatted,
                it is
                simply dumped as a
                copy/paste. I will format it at a later stage. For now the old site is still viewable as the README.md

            <h2><br><br>Day 2 - Tuesday May 3rd 2022</h2>
            <p>## I Want To Make Videogames Day 2 - Tuesday May 3rd 2022
                > When I first got serious about trying to write a game I considered trying to translate an existing
                tabeltop game
                to a simple rpg. I thought the concrete rules and straightforward random dice rolls would make it easier
                to work
                on but there were so many challenges and I hadn't anticipated. I quickly realised that there were
                concepts and
                techniques used for the most basic things that I had no idea how to implement. Even a simple game has a
                lot of
                moving parts.
                > Loops have always frustrated me. I'm not sure why. I understand the logic, the layout, the order I'm
                supposed to
                type my code but for some reason when it comes time to build my own solution and use a loop for
                something
                meaningful it's like they get prickly, or messy. I'm using them a lot in the
                [Porklike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS) tutorial so I think
                that will
                make them stick.
                > Writing my starship sreensaver game thing helped a lot too. I had to iterate through all the positions
                and
                update everything, obviously loops were a big help in doing that. I have a lot of fun trying to animate
                little
                pixel art scenes and environments, loops will certainly make effects like rain easier.
                > I've added a link to the educational version of pico 8 above. It is the complete software running in a
                browser
                window, and it currently requires a phyiscal hard drive. If you use the save command you can download
                your work so
                it's great for trying out the software or coding on the go! </p>
            <h2>Day 1 - Monday May 2nd 2022</h2>
            <p>## I Want To Make Videogames Day 1 - Monday May 2nd 2022
                > It was Command and Conquer Red Alert that cemented part of my personal identity as that of gamer. I
                remember
                selecting the big boxed version of it from the shelf. It came bundled with a red Soviet mouse. It was
                the coolest
                thing I’d ever seen. I wonder how many gamers try to make games? I’m sure we all think about doing it.
                Currently I
                am 12 episodes into the wonderful
                [Porklike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS) tutorial series by
                Lazy Devs
                Academy and the wonderful @krystman @ [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) I intend to post once a
                day and
                update on my progress until I’ve released a finished game. Who knows what will happen after that.
                > The tool I’ve had the most fun using has been pico 8. It contains everything you need to make a
                complete self
                contained little game. The first thing I ever wrote in it that worked was an ultra simple tamagotchi. If
                you’re
                interested in game development it’s definitely worth using it and running through some tutorials to get
                a feel for
                how putting a game together works. I’m also trying to learn the Godot engine but working through it at a
                much
                slower pace. I backed a kickstarter for a complete game dev course using Godot so I am following that,
                but for now
                the focus will be these pico 8 tutorials until I complete them.
                > That will about do it for today I think. Tomorrow I will write a bit more about what I know and what I
                think I’m
                in the middle of learning. To anyone out there struggling to make games, do it daily. Stick with it and
                give it a
                bit of time each day. Follow structured tutorials and even if you don’t understand everything keep
                moving forward
                with it. The more you complete the more you are learning, and the more things you break the better you
                get at
                learning.
